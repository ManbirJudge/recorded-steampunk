# Recorded Steampunk
**[NOTE: Work in progress]**

Record your performance in your school tests using the power of Excel and a little magic of programming.

## Motivation
- Wanted to build a personal school test perforance recorder application kind-of thing.
- Wanted to build something with VBA after years of not working with it. It was the 2rd programming language I learned after Python (3rd if you consider BASIC, but I was not serious about it).
- Wanted to give myself a challenge (i.e. working with VBA).
- Wanted to do something new and have fun.

## TODOS
- Fix downloading and uploading empty test records (i.e. with length = 0).
- More checks for `add new test form` input data in the VBA itself rather than on the server.
- A simple mobile and/or web application for accessing the record on the go.
- Find a better to distribute the project for actual use and not just for developement.
- Host the server.
